test:

pubrunner --test https://github.com/jakelever/pubrunner/tree/master/examples/CountWords

https://github.com/saverymax/textmining-test.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/saverymax/textmining-test.git


Jakes advice:
I put together a little script that can convert the BioC XML format to a tab-delimited file (which may be easier to work with).
So in the pubrunner.yml file, you would change format to bioc for all the resources.
And then add in a command like this: python convertBioCToTSV.py --inBioC {IN:PUBMED/%} --outTSV {OUT:PUBMED_TSV/%.tsv}
(before you run Sentiment Analysis)
Then your Sentiment Analysis script could load this tab-delimited file instead of dealing with an XML or TXT file
